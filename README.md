Machine learning algorithm for heath problems prediction 🤖💔👨‍⚕️

### Case 1. Coronary Heart Disease
Objective: With the use of provided data from UCI archives, create and train a dense neural network to predict to classify the presense of heart disease.

### Case 2. Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis
Objective: Use convolutional neural networks to classify medical images. The main objective is to use convolutional neural networks to create a binary classifier for diabetic retinopathy images with the use of provided data

### Case 3. Patient Drug Review
Objective: Use neural networks to process text data and predict ratings associated to the text. The main objective is to use recurrent and convolutional neural networks to create a predictor for a collection of patient drug reviews extracted from Drugs.com. Drugs.com is a comprehensive source of drug information online.
